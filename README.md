# ollama-discord-bot
silly ai bot that uses ollama and discord.py to talk when you ping it 

# dependencies
2. discord.py
3. asyncio (included with python)
4. ollama python module
5. base64 (should be included in python)

# how to do shiz!!
1. change model of your choice (change the variable `model` with your model)
2. you can make the bot respond to everything AND choose which servers it will respond to, including channels!!
3. insert shiz here1!!1

# features
1. responds to reply pings and regular pings
2. can remember stuff, memories/history is for specific channels rather than globally
3. image support (if the model supports it)
5. extremely simple, !clear to clear channel history (thats the only command)
6. responds to other bots! (i wouldnt call it a feature but more rather a thing that im too lazy to fix)
